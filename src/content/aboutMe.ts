Hello everyone! My name is Paul. Welcome to my home page. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UWaterloo. I am passionate about building scalable software and have experience with backend development using Spring, as well as tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I am currently a Software Engineer at Clari with 4 years of experience. My work focuses on developing robust backend systems and improving build infrastructure. I've recently been migrating our build system from Gradle to Bazel for better performance and scalability.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring food in the city, playing badminton, basketball, and staying fit. I'm also passionate about learning new technologies and constantly improving my skills in data structures, algorithms, and system design.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to connect with me!
