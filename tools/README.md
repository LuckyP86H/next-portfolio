This folder contains developer tooling and generated assets used for project visualization and tests.

- `static/` : trimmed copies of generated static assets used by the Nx dep graph viewer. Keep these only for local viewing.
- `playwright.config.js` : Playwright config for running end-to-end smoke tests locally.

If you want to regenerate the dep graph or static bundle, run `npm run dep-graph` or your NX commands. These files were moved to keep the repository root clean.# Madge file-level dependency viewer

This folder contains the JSON output from `madge` and a small interactive D3 viewer.

Files:
- `madge-deps.json` — file-to-file dependency map generated by `npx madge --json src > tools/madge-deps.json`.
- `madge-deps.html` — interactive viewer (D3) that loads `madge-deps.json` and renders a force-directed graph.

How to use:
1. From the repo root run (already done in this branch):

```
npx madge --extensions ts,tsx,js,jsx --json src > tools/madge-deps.json
```

2. Open `tools/madge-deps.html` in your browser (double-click or `open tools/madge-deps.html` on macOS).

Notes:
- This viewer does not require Graphviz. If you prefer a static SVG output, install Graphviz (`brew install graphviz`) and run madge with the `--image` option.

Starting the interactive viewer (recommended)

- Option A (npm script): from the repo root run:

```
npm run serve:tools
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000/madge-deps.html
```

- Option B (python, same command used by npm script):

```
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory tools
```

Important: Do NOT open the HTML with file:// in your browser — fetch() is blocked for local files. Use the server above so the page can load `madge-deps.json`.
